# 🔧 Bug Fixes Applied

## Issue: Loading Popup Never Shows Content

### Root Cause
The extension showed "Loading..." but never displayed the ChatGPT response. This could happen due to:
1. API errors not being properly caught
2. Network failures
3. Invalid API key
4. Silent failures with no error messages

### What Was Fixed

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `background.js`
- ✅ Added detailed console logging at each step
- ✅ Added specific error messages for common issues:
  - `401`: "Invalid API key"
  - `429`: "Rate limit exceeded"
  - `Failed to fetch`: "Network error"
- ✅ Added `temperature: 0.7` parameter for better responses
- ✅ Better error object parsing

#### 2. Enhanced Debugging in `content.js`
- ✅ Added console logs when messages are received
- ✅ Added logs when popup is displayed
- ✅ Added log when popup auto-closes
- ✅ Fixed auto-close timer (was set to 150M ms, now 15 seconds)

#### 3. Created Debugging Guide
- ✅ Created `DEBUGGING.md` with comprehensive troubleshooting steps
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with pricing information
- ✅ Added instructions for checking console logs

## How to Debug Now

### Step 1: Check Background Service Worker
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Ask ChatGPT"
3. Click **"service worker"** (blue link)
4. Try the extension
5. Watch for these logs:

```
🔄 Calling OpenAI API with text: your text...
📡 API Response status: 200
✅ API Response received: {...}
💬 Answer: The actual response
```

If you see an error instead:
- ❌ `401` = Invalid API key → Check your settings
- ❌ `429` = Rate limit → Wait a few minutes
- ❌ `Failed to fetch` = Network issue → Check internet

### Step 2: Check Content Script (Webpage Console)
1. Open any webpage
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try the extension
5. Watch for these logs:

```
📩 Content script received message: {...}
🎨 Showing popup: {...}
⏰ Auto-closing popup (after 15 seconds)
```

If you don't see these logs:
- The message didn't reach the content script
- Reload the webpage and try again

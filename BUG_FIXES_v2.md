## 🎯 ISSUE #1: Text Disappears Quickly

### Problem
When the popup transitioned from "Loading..." to the actual ChatGPT response, it would:
1. Show "Loading..." with spinner
2. Remove the entire popup (with fade-out animation = 300ms)
3. Create a new popup with the response
4. During the removal animation, the popup would disappear

This made it look like the text "disappeared quickly"!

### Root Cause
In `content.js`, the `showPopup()` function was calling `removePopup()` every time, even when updating from loading to content:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (BUGGY):
function showPopup(content, theme, isLoading) {
  // Remove existing popup if any
  if (currentPopup) {
    removePopup(); // ❌ This removed the popup even when updating!
  }
  // ... create new popup from scratch
}
```

### Solution
**Update the popup content in-place** instead of removing and recreating:

```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED):
function showPopup(content, theme, isLoading) {
  // If popup already exists, just update its content
  if (currentPopup) {
    console.log('📝 Updating existing popup content');
    const contentDiv = currentPopup.querySelector('.chatgpt-content');
    
    if (isLoading) {
      contentDiv.innerHTML = `...loading HTML...`;
    } else {
      contentDiv.textContent = content; // ✅ Just update text!
      // Start auto-dismiss timer here
    }
    return; // ✅ Don't recreate popup
  }
  // ... only create new popup if none exists
}
```

**Result**: Now the popup smoothly updates from "Loading..." to the response without disappearing! 🎉

## 🎯 ISSUE #2: Loader Spinner Not Working

### Problem
The loading spinner animation might not be visible or not spinning.

### Root Cause
The CSS animation was defined but could have been:
- Too light/transparent
- Too small to see
- Animation timing too slow

### Solution
Enhanced the spinner CSS in `styles.css`:

```css
/* OLD SPINNER: */
.chatgpt-spinner {
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  border: 3px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Too light! */
  border-top-color: #667eea;
  animation: chatgpt-spin 0.8s linear infinite;
}

/* NEW SPINNER: */
.chatgpt-spinner {
  width: 24px;                                    /* ✅ Bigger */
  height: 24px;
  border: 3px solid rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.2);    /* ✅ More visible */
  border-top-color: #667eea;                      /* ✅ Purple top */
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: chatgpt-spin 0.6s linear infinite;   /* ✅ Faster spin */
  flex-shrink: 0;                                 /* ✅ Don't shrink */
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Increased size from 20px to 24px (more visible)
- ✅ Changed border color to use purple tones (better contrast)
- ✅ Faster animation (0.6s instead of 0.8s)
- ✅ Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent squishing
- ✅ Explicit animation keyframes (0% and 100%)

**Result**: Spinner is now clearly visible and spins smoothly! 🔄

## 🎯 ISSUE #3: Extension Icons

### Status
The extension icons ARE already configured correctly!

### What's Already Working
✅ Icons exist in `/icons` folder:
  - `icon16.png` (16x16)
  - `icon48.png` (48x48)  
  - `icon128.png` (128x128)

✅ `manifest.json` correctly references them:
```json
{
  "action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/icon16.png",
      "48": "icons/icon48.png",
      "128": "icons/icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  }
}
```

### If Icons Don't Appear

**Quick Fix:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the **reload icon** (🔄) next to "Ask ChatGPT"
3. Reload any open webpages
4. Icons should now appear!

**If Still Not Working:**
1. Remove the extension completely
2. Click "Load unpacked" again
3. Select the folder
